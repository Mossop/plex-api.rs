# How to contribute

I'm delighted you're reading this, and I hope you'll find this project easy to jump in.

## First steps

The project uses [cargo-husky](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-husky) for managing the git
hooks. After you cloned the repository you need to run `cargo test` at least once, to
install the correct hooks configuration.

## Testing

The project provides a sample Plex library for testing, feel free to extend it the way you
see fit. The `cargo xtask plex-data` command populates the test library from the stub data.
If you need to add additional media to the library you should modify the lists in
[`crates/xtask/src/plex_data.rs`](crates/xtask/src/plex_data.rs). To modify the library structure
such as categories and playlists use the `cargo xtask modify-data` command to start plex against
the test data and use the web interface to make the modifications you need. Note that the first
time you run the server against the test data you will have to accept Plex's terms of service.
Assuming you have read and agreed to them you can do this from the command line:
```
cargo run -p plex-cli -- -s {server_url} preferences set --i-know-what-i-am-doing -k AcceptedEULA -v true
```

There are multiple test types available:

* Offline tests, with mock data.
* Online tests using a claimed (i.e. assigned to a MyPlex account) local docker container.
* Online tests using an unclaimed local docker container.

The easiest way to run all the available tests is by executing the following command:

```
cargo xtask test
```

## Committing

Please follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when writing commit
messages.

## Writing tests

I don't have much exprience with testing in Rust, so please write the tests the way you see fit.
At the same time, I created a few macros to reduce the boilerplate amount:
* `#[plex_api_test_helper::offline_test]`
* `#[plex_api_test_helper::online_test_unclaimed_server]`
* `#[plex_api_test_helper::online_test_claimed_server]`
* `#[plex_api_test_helper::online_test]`

[rstest](http://docs.rs/rstest) is used under the hood for handling the tests â€” this way
it's possible to use [fixtures](https://docs.rs/rstest/latest/rstest/attr.rstest.html#injecting-fixtures) and
[tests parametrization](https://docs.rs/rstest/latest/rstest/attr.rstest.html#test-parametrized-cases).

Please use those when writing integration tests.

Thanks,
Andrey Yantsen
